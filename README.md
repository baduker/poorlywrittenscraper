## poorly written scraper
### Is a Python comic(al) scraper for poorlydrawnlines.com

First, the script fetches the all published comics from [poorlydrwanlines] archive (poorlydrawnlines.com/archive) and then let's you download all or some of the comics.

In order to run the script, just grab the **poorlywrritenscript.py** file and fire it up in your **Python 3.x** environment. The images will be downloaded and saved in a septate folder in your current working directory.

Should you have any issues, questions and/or suggestions feel free to drop me a line.

Enjoy the comics!
