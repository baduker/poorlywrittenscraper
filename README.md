[![pws.png](https://s9.postimg.org/fy21b4c5b/pws.png)](https://postimg.org/image/uu0kipnjv/)
#### Is a Python comic(al) scraper for [poorlydrawnlines.com](poorlydrawnlines.com)

First, the script fetches and indexes all published comics from [poorlydrawnlines archive](poorlydrawnlines.com/archive) and then it lets you download all or some of the comics.

In order to run the script, just grab the **poorlywrritenscript.py** file and fire it up in your **Python 3.x** environment. The images will be downloaded and saved in a septate folder in your current working directory.

Should you have any issues, questions and/or suggestions feel free to drop me a line.

Enjoy the comics!
