#### PWS is a Python comic(al) scraper for [poorlydrawnlines.com](poorlydrawnlines.com)

The script fetches and indexes all published comics from [poorlydrawnlines archive](poorlydrawnlines.com/archive) and then it lets you download all or some of the comics.

In order to run the script, just grab the **poorlywrritenscript.py** file and fire it up in your **Python 3.x** environment. The images will be downloaded and saved in a septate folder in your current working directory.

#### Requirements:
In order to run, the scrip needs the following third party modules:
+ `requests`
