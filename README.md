# poorlywrittenscraper
Is a Python comic(al) scraper for poorlydrawnlines.com

The script fetches the number of published comics from poorlydrawnlines.com/archive and let's you download all or some of the comics.

In order to run in, just grab the poorlywrritenscript.py file and fire it up in your Python 3.x environment. The images will be downloaded and saved in a septate folder in your current working directory.

Should you have any issues, questions and/or suggestions feel free to drop me a line.

Enjoy the comics!
